				<p>Hi! Thanks for passing by. I've been consulting for the past 3+ years, and worked in a variety of industries for the past 6 years with a core focus in providing unforgettable customer/client experiences using my affinity for social media to help businesses, large and small amplify their brands through online and offline campaigns, paid advertising strategies and events marketing. I am currently attending NY Code + Design Academy to learn Front End Development to better assist the brands we work with/will work with at Firebrand Group.</p>
